Running basic DDP example on rank 0.

 Creating Dataset:
    Dataset Subsampled by factor of 2
     Cell Centres Converted to Cell Verticies using average pooling (this reduces the size of each dimension by one)
     Boundary Data added by padding and adding extra cells (this increases the size of each dimension by two)
    Queries Normalized with Means: tensor([[0.5000, 0.5000]]) and Stds: tensor([[0.2909, 0.2909]])
    Datset Normalized with Means: tensor([[ 0.0043,  0.0001, -0.0335]], dtype=torch.float64) and Stds: tensor([[0.2234, 0.1848, 0.1516]], dtype=torch.float64)

Creating Dataloader:
    Dataset Split up for inference using torch generator seed: 42
    Training Datset Selected
